Hello @everyone in FurPals,

As you may or may not have observed, we may have been targeted as part of a spam and harassment campaign.  The origin and motivation of this campaign are unknown.

In response to this campaign, the participating users have been banned, and all invite links have been revoked.

The banned users include:

    Enes#9047
    sringe#4990
    static#8125
    tessa :rainbow::butterfly:#1990

One of the users had created an instant invite code which was spread to the other spammers, but has since been revoked to prevent further joins.

As a precautionary action, the following users have also been banned due to inactivity (or offensive usernames, as denoted by an asterisk):

    Blaul Part#4996
    tech cunt#9656*
    Young Chin#8345

As a note and reminder, FurPals and its mods are not responsible for any other messages you may receive on other social networks or messaging services as a result of this campaign.  This includes, but is not limited to, Tumblr asks/messages, FurAffinity notes/comments/shouts, Twitter tweets/DMs, and other platforms.

We will continue to monitor the situation. 

Just a reminder, we value the safety and comfort of our members.  Diversity and inclusion are pillars of this group, and we respect and acknowledge the identity of all.  We apologize for the inconvenience, and we hope you understand.

Best,

Pat
